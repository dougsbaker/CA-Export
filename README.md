# CA-Export

This tool is designed to help save your CA policys as a html format for external review or documentaion.

Run the Script using

```posh
.\Export-CaPolicy.ps1
```

The Script Automically connects to the Graph Module if you are not connected. If you need to change environments you can manually disconnect using the below command.

```posh
Disconnect-MgGraph
```

Sample output
![CaExport-result](CaExport-result.png)

## What is new?

This tool has been updated to version 2.0 so that it maintains support for new features as they come out.

The other Large Change in V2.0 is updateding the styling of the export so it is a little easier to read, and now the selects properly target the whole column.
